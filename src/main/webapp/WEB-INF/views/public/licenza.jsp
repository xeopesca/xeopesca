							<p><strong>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Version 3, 29 June 2007</strong></p>
			<p></p>
			<p> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/></p>
			<p> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</p>
			<p> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates</p>
			<p>the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public</p>
			<p>License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  0. Additional Definitions.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser</p>
			<p>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU</p>
			<p>General Public License.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,</p>
			<p>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided</p>
			<p>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.</p>
			<p>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode</p>
			<p>of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an</p>
			<p>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library</p>
			<p>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked</p>
			<p>Version".</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the</p>
			<p>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code</p>
			<p>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are</p>
			<p>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the</p>
			<p>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data</p>
			<p>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the</p>
			<p>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License</p>
			<p>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a</p>
			<p>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application</p>
			<p>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the</p>
			<p>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified</p>
			<p>version:</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to</p>
			<p>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the</p>
			<p>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs</p>
			<p>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of</p>
			<p>   this License applicable to that copy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from</p>
			<p>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object</p>
			<p>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated</p>
			<p>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure</p>
			<p>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates</p>
			<p>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the</p>
			<p>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</p>
			<p>   covered by this License.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</p>
			<p>   document.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  4. Combined Works.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,</p>
			<p>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the</p>
			<p>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse</p>
			<p>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of</p>
			<p>the following:</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that</p>
			<p>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are</p>
			<p>   covered by this License.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license</p>
			<p>   document.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during</p>
			<p>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among</p>
			<p>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the</p>
			<p>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   d) Do one of the following:</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this</p>
			<p>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form</p>
			<p>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to</p>
			<p>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of</p>
			<p>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the</p>
			<p>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying</p>
			<p>       Corresponding Source.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</p>
			<p>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time</p>
			<p>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer</p>
			<p>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version</p>
			<p>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked</p>
			<p>       Version.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise</p>
			<p>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the</p>
			<p>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is</p>
			<p>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the</p>
			<p>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the</p>
			<p>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If</p>
			<p>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany</p>
			<p>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application</p>
			<p>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation</p>
			<p>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL</p>
			<p>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  5. Combined Libraries.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</p>
			<p>Library side by side in a single library together with other library</p>
			<p>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this</p>
			<p>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your</p>
			<p>choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based</p>
			<p>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,</p>
			<p>   conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it</p>
			<p>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the</p>
			<p>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</p>
			<p>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new</p>
			<p>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may</p>
			<p>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the</p>
			<p>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version</p>
			<p>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"</p>
			<p>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and</p>
			<p>conditions either of that published version or of any later version</p>
			<p>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you</p>
			<p>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser</p>
			<p>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser</p>
			<p>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide</p>
			<p>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall</p>
			<p>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is</p>
			<p>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the</p>
			<p>Library.</p>
